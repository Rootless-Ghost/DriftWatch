# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Only the latest release is actively supported with security updates.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in DriftWatch, please report it
responsibly. Do **not** open a public GitHub issue.

1. Email the maintainer directly (see repository contact info).
2. Include a clear description of the vulnerability and reproduction steps.
3. Allow reasonable time for a fix before any public disclosure.

## Scope

DriftWatch is designed to run locally as a developer/analyst tool. It should
**not** be exposed directly to the internet without additional authentication
and hardening.

- Sigma rule YAML and event JSON inputs are parsed server-side — do not accept
  untrusted input from external sources in production.
- The SQLite database (`driftwatch.db`) contains saved reports — ensure it is
  not readable by untrusted users.
- The Flask development server (`debug: true`) should never be used in
  production.

## Out of Scope

- Issues in third-party dependencies (report to the respective project).
- Issues requiring physical access to the host machine.
